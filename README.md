#  	Classify tumor and non-tumor from Brain MRI using Convolution Neural Network
We train a Neural Network to classify MRI Scan of a patientâ€™s brain obtained in the axial plane as whether there is a presence of tumor or not also, we can feed in an individual MRI image and check whether it has a tumor or not.
